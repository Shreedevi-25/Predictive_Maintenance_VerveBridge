1. Data Loading and Exploration: You load a dataset from a CSV file ("/content/data.csv") and explore its structure, summary statistics, and missing values.
2. Data Visualization: You create scatter plots to visualize the relationships between footfall, air quality (AQ), and temperature mode.
3. Data Preparation: You separate the features (predictors) from the target variable (footfall) and split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training: You train a linear regression model using the training data.
5. Prediction: You use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.
6. Model Evaluation: You evaluate the performance of the model using the 'score' method.
